Objects: collection of properties (key: 'values') within a variable.
Properties: key: 'values'; it is what makes the object up.
Methods: functions within an object.
for in loop: loop that iterates through an object.
dot notation vs bracket notation: dot notation is used for one-word properties, while brackets are used for the rest. Dot notation is
specific and refers to the actual word/input, while bracket notation does not.
